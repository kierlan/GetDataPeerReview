##Instructions
Before running the code, you should have:

1. Downloaded the data from here:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

2. Unzipped the UCI HAR Dataset folder in your working directory (so that for example, "./UCI HAR Dataset/README.txt" opens the readme file for the dataset).

After running the code, a clean dataset will appear in your working directory, called tidyData.txt, as well as a larger dataset from which it has been derived, called TotalData.txt.

The code is commented, and the rest of the steps are explained within the code.

I would have written more here, but there is no more time left. :D

If you have any questions, leave them in the comments.
